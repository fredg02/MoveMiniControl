# Move Mini Controller

This is an example Android app that allows to control a [BBC micro:bit](https://microbit.org/) in combination with a [:MOVE mini](https://www.kitronik.co.uk/5624-move-mini-buggy-kit-excl-microbit.html) robot over Bluetooth LE.

Since the only(?) other app that was available on the Google Play store was/is not free, I had a good motivation to write my own app.

Some of the Bluetooth related code was borrowed from the [Crazyflie Control app](https://github.com/bitcraze/crazyflie-android-client).

## Features

* Basic controls for the [:MOVE mini](https://www.kitronik.co.uk/5624-move-mini-buggy-kit-excl-microbit.html) (Forward, Backward, Left & Right) 
* On-screen DPAD
* hex file and screenshot 
* Tests to make sure that Bluetooth and Location are activated


## Get Started

1. Download the hex file from the hexfiles directory and copy it on to your micro:bit.
2. Download the APK file or clone this GitHub repo and build it yourself
3. Install the APK on your mobile device
4. Pair the micro:bit to your phone (It is recommended to use the "nRF Connect" app from Nordic for pairing)
5. Connect to the micro:bit by clicking "Connect" (this might take a few seconds!)
6. Once the connection is established the micro:bit should show a smiling face.
7. Use the DPAD controls to steer the [:MOVE mini](https://www.kitronik.co.uk/5624-move-mini-buggy-kit-excl-microbit.html) and have fun! :)
